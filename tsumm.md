Table summarization project aims to build a natural language interface to allow users to access information in the tabular data. We assume the presence of specific content that needs to be described, indicated by either user-provided natural language query or system-provided (mined insights) highlighted table region, and we aim to explore effective methods to generate fluent, coherent, faithful and logically entailed description based on the user intent and the table. Once we achieve this aim, we seek to adapt our system to cope with real world application settings with multiple tables with complex schema and complex/ambiguous user queries. In the end, we seek to build the natural language interface by adapting our system to the dialogue setting.
