    <h2 class="post-title">NLP for Electronic Patient Records</h2>
  </header> 
The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is an essential part of the modern medical system and impacts healthcare delivery, operations, and research. Unstructured text is attracting much attention despite structured information in the EHRs and has become an exciting research field. In this project, we implement a python toolkit, EHRKit, by integrating the state-of-the-art python libraries and creating the interface to work on user-input clinical/biomedical text. For example, huggingface, SciSpacy and Stanza. We are aiming at making more functionalities and running evaluations.
